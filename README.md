# Dancing-Alarm
My code for family member's idea of an alarm that uses a dancing animal.

IDEA: to help those with hearing problems notice an alarm going off, specifically a kitchen alarm/timer, add a motion signal to catch their attention. In this case a dancing monkey. The store bought toy being used only danced for ~30 sec before shuting off, which is undesireable for an alarm. In addition, we needed to bypass the built in button that triggered the toy so that we could link it to the alarm. To do this, a circuit was built in place of the button which when taking an input signal (the alarm) would trigger a relay that would simuate a button press, and repeatedly do so at set intervals to restart the toy when it's cycle finished. This would continue until the input turned off.
